# Automatic Negative Thoughts (ANTs) 

###About the Project
This is an introduction to what the 9 types of Automatic Negative Thoughts are and how to deal with them.

Everyone has thoughts but most of the time we don't think about what our thoughts are and how it can affect our lives either positively or negatively.

ANTs can cause people to be depressed and spiral into a deep hole of isolation and misery.

I hope to present ANTs in a simple and friendly way so that more people can learn to identify the negative thoughts in their lives. I believe if we can equip ourselves with the knowledge to combat each type of negative thoughts we may live more enjoyable lives.
